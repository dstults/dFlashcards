Decide which sides of the cards you want to test and which you can ignore:

(For instance, if you need to practice reading the left side and knowing what goes on the middle/right sides, use the following setup:)

Based off your reaction speed (instant = good, 0.5-2s hesitation = slow, > 2s or "don't know" = bad), score yourself:

Once you get through an entire deck, it will restart:

Ideally, you should be able to complete your entire deck without any "slow" or "bad" scores in order to get perfect on your next exam.
