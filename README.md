### Based off your reaction speed (instant = good, 0.5-2s hesitation = slow, > 2s or "don't know" = bad), score yourself:

## Expert Advice:
- ProTip #1: Ideally, you should be able to complete your entire deck without any "slow" or "bad" scores in order to get perfect on your next exam.
- ProTip #2: Use the indicated keyboard shortcuts for faster memorization.
- ProTip #3: You can hit "Good" "Slow" "Bad" even without showing the cards.

# How to Make your own Flashcards

1) Make a new text file.
2) Every card is one line of text.
3) Use vertical bars **|** (shift-\) to separate sides of one card.
4) A two-sided card should have one vertical bar, a three-sided card should have two vertical bars.
5) Here is a screenshot of a sample card file:

6) The cards are designed to auto-scale, but results may vary. Feel [free to post an issue](https://github.com/dstults/dFlashcards/issues) if you find one.

# Future Plans ?
